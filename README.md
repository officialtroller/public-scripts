# public-scripts

This is a Repo of all my public scripts for [Code Injector](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/443953-code-injector-starblast-io).

I do provide a modified Version of Code Injector under `codeinjector.user.js` with some small standard modifications to the game client.

<a id="important">When using Spoof ECP Mod make sure to follow its alert that pops up when launching the Game as it does modify your ECP and i do not take any Responsibility if something happens.</a>

Most of them are just copy-pasted from other/old scripts and modified.

Source is free to use/modify with credits (although i know you guys wont do it anyways).
